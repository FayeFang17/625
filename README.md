# 625

This package calculates Fst from SNP inputs. SNPs impletmented the Fst function from the package KIRS, with more efficient coding.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Usage

The main function in the package is Fst.

* `sim_SNP`: SNP datasets could be simulated with this function. (But they are rather unrealistic, so do not use them forany purpose other than package tutorial.)
